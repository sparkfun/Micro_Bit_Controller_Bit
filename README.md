The SparkFun controller:bit is a fun-filled “carrier” board for the micro:bit that, when combined with the micro:bit, provides you with a fully functional game system. Designed in a similar form factor to the classic Nintendo NES controller, the controller:bit is equipped with a four-direction “D-pad” on the left side of the board and two action buttons on the right side of the board. The two push buttons on the micro:bit in the center function as start and select. The back of the board also includes poke-home connectors if you decide to go retro by connecting connect arcade buttons and switches. Check out the micro:arcade kit if you decide to build your very own arcade cabinet using the micro:bit!
